# Apple-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission
This repo contains the resources related to my project Apple's Greenhouse Gas Emisssion Project.

Analysed Data from the year 2015 to 2022, which helps us to understand greenhouse gas emissions reduction, Revenue growth, Market capitalization and Carbon Footprint changes over time.
It showcases my ability to use employ SQL for some deep dives into the data, and create dashboards in Power BI that are designed to be user-friendly.

The dataset I have used is from Maven Analytics.

## Inroduction
This data contains three tables " Carbon footprint by Product", "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" and " Normalizing Factor". 
Using these tables we will first undersatnd the data and the then dive into getting insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Anslysed Dataset by two methords:
- SQL Analysis 
- Power BI Visualizations

##  Insights 
- In 2015, carbon footprint stood at 38.4 million mertic tons of CO2. It decreased significantly in 2022 with 20.3 million metric tons of CO2.
- Scope 1 emissions is the rising high each year, While Scope 2 and Scope 3 emission show a significant deline ober the years.
- Product life cycle emission contributes an average of over 98% of total emission.
- Business travel and Employee commute consitute 98% of the total emissions.
- The highest carbon footprint is associated with iPhone X (79).
- The iPhone 6s has the lowest carbon footprint (54) among the listed models.
- Average carbon footprint across models is approximately 68.4%. 
- Revenue and market capitalization grew significantly from 2016 to 2022.
- The sharpest growth occurred post-2020, with market capitalization exceeding 2500 (Millions) by 2022.
