# Apple-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission
This repo contains the resources related to my project Apple's Greenhouse Gas Emisssion Project.

Analysed Data from the year 2015 to 2022, which helps us to understand greenhouse gas emissions reduction, Revenue growth, Market capitalization and Carbon Footprint changes over time.
It showcases my ability to use employ SQL for some deep dives into the data, and create dashboards in Power BI that are designed to be user-friendly.

The dataset I have used is from Maven Analytics.

## Inroduction
This data contains three tables " Carbon footprint by Product", "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" and " Normalizing Factor". 
Using these tables we will first undersatnd the data and the then dive into getting insights.
